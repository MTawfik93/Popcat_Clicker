# Popcat_Clicker

Create an Environment either with conda or virtualenv or any other, then activate it and install Selenium with

```pip3 install selenium```

Run the code using 

```python clickerbot.py```

The code uses Google Chrome as a default browser, in case if you want to change it, download the new browser's driver and add it to the lib directory, change the path line 3

> driver = webdriver.Chrome("path/to/the/BrowserDriver.exe")

And Happy counting !!
